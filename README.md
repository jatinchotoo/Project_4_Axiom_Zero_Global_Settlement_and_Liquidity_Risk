## Refined narrative (drop into your README)

```markdown
> **Axiom‑Zero is a pre‑trade settlement governor for treasury and liquidity desks. It enforces capital‑preservation rules so that large-value payments only release when market volatility, liquidity depth, and internal risk limits are simultaneously satisfied.**

---

## 📋 Strategic Overview

Traditional risk management explains losses **after** they occur. **Axiom‑Zero** shifts governance to the **decision point**, turning settlement release into a controlled, auditable risk event.

By operating as a **circuit breaker** for treasury operations, the engine ingests real-time market telemetry and balance‑sheet signals to determine whether a settlement is **Authorised** or **Hard‑Blocked**.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Pre‑Execution Gating:** Intercepts capital outflows before risk is crystallised.  
- **Quantum Volatility Index (QVI):** Proprietary variance signal that scores market stability across time and liquidity regimes.  
- **Executive Decision Intelligence:** One‑glance, zero‑click control panel designed for CFO, Treasurer, and CRO workflows.
