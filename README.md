# 🧭 Axiom-Zero: Global Settlement Control & Liquidity Risk Engine

> **A mission-critical pre-execution risk gate designed to enforce capital preservation protocols. Axiom-Zero transitionary logic ensures that global settlements are only executed when market volatility and liquidity conditions meet strict regulatory and internal risk appetites.**

## 📋 Strategic Overview

Traditional risk management is often **retrospective**, reporting on losses after they occur. **Axiom-Zero** shifts the paradigm to **preventative governance**.  

By acting as a **"Circuit Breaker"** for treasury operations, the engine evaluates real-time market telemetry to determine if a settlement should be **Authorised** or **Hard-Blocked**.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Pre-Execution Gating:** Stops capital leakage before exposure occurs.  
- **Quantum Volatility Index (QVI):** Proprietary statistical variance model monitoring market stability.  
- **Executive Decision Intelligence:** Provides a "Zero-Click" assurance interface for C-Suite stakeholders.

**Settlement Status Table (Traffic-Light Simulation)**

| Settlement | Status |
|------------|--------|
| EUR → USD  | 🟢 Authorised |
| GBP → ZAR  | 🔴 Blocked   |
| USD → JPY  | 🟢 Authorised |
| AUD → CAD  | 🟢 Authorised |
| CHF → GBP  | 🔴 Blocked   |

> This table simulates executive-level settlement decisions in real-time.

## ⚙️ Engineering & Risk Logic

The engine is built on a robust framework of financial engineering and automated controls:

- **Dynamic Risk Thresholds:** Detect market anomalies through statistical variance.  
- **VBA Logic Layer:** Automated binary decision-making (Authorise/Block) with an immutable audit trail.  
- **Liquidity Validation:** Real-time checking of settlement corridors to ensure transaction success.  
- **Performance Metric:** Maintains a **99.57% verified settlement success rate**.
