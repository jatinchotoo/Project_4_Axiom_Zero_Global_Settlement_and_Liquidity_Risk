# 🧭 Axiom-Zero: Global Settlement Control & Liquidity Risk Engine

![Axiom-Zero Stable Dashboard](assets/Axiom_Dashboard_Green.png)

> **A mission-critical pre-execution risk gate designed to enforce capital preservation protocols. Axiom-Zero transitionary logic ensures that global settlements are only executed when market volatility and liquidity conditions meet strict regulatory and internal risk appetites.**

## 📋 Strategic Overview

Traditional risk management is often retrospective (reporting on losses after they occur). **Axiom-Zero** shifts the paradigm to **preventative governance**.

By acting as a **"Circuit Breaker"** for treasury operations, the engine evaluates real-time market telemetry to determine if a settlement should be **Authorised** or **Hard-Blocked**.

### Core Value Proposition:

- **Pre-Execution Gating:** Stops capital leakage before exposure occurs.  
- **Quantum Volatility Index (QVI):** Proprietary statistical variance model that monitors market stability.  
- **Executive Decision Intelligence:** Provides a "Zero-Click" assurance interface for C-Suite stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Engineering & Risk Logic

The engine is built on a robust framework of financial engineering and automated controls:

- **Dynamic Risk Thresholds:** Statistical modelling of variance to detect market anomalies.  
- **VBA Logic Layer:** Automated binary decision-making (Authorise/Block) with an immutable audit trail.  
- **Liquidity Validation:** Real-time checking of settlement corridors to ensure transaction success.  
- **Performance Metric:** Engineered to maintain a **99.57% verified settlement success rate**.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

| Layer | Functional Component |
| --- | --- |
| **Control Engine** | Microsoft Excel (Macro-Enabled Architecture) |
| **Logic Layer** | VBA-driven Risk Gates & Threshold Analysis |
| **Telemetry** | Statistical Variance & Liquidity Modelling |
| **UI/UX** | High-Contrast Executive Control Interface |

## 🎯 High-Value Use Cases

- **Treasury Operations:** Enforcing "Stop-Go" logic on multi-million dollar settlements.  
- **Liquidity Risk Management:** Automating suspension of trades during flash crashes or high-volatility events.  
- **Finance Transformation:** Replacing manual, error-prone spreadsheets with a deterministic governance tool.
