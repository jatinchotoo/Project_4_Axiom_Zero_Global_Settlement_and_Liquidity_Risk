# Axiom-Zero  
## 🌍 Global Settlement Control & Liquidity Risk Engine

🧭 **Axiom-Zero** is a **pre-execution settlement control engine** designed to safeguard treasury and liquidity operations by enforcing **real-time risk gates before capital is deployed**.

Unlike traditional reporting dashboards that surface risk *after* exposure, Axiom-Zero operates as a **preventative control layer**, evaluating market stability conditions and determining whether settlements are **authorised, paused, or blocked**.

This project demonstrates **decision intelligence, financial risk governance, and executive-grade reporting**, implemented using Microsoft Excel and VBA as a rapid-control prototyping environment.

## 📊 Executive Control Dashboard — System Stable

When volatility and liquidity indicators remain within approved thresholds, the engine authorises settlement execution and displays a **GREEN (STABLE)** operational state.

![System Stable Dashboard](Project_4_Axiom-Zero-Global-Settlement/assets/Axiom_Dashboard_Green.png)

### Executive Interpretation
- Market volatility within tolerance  
- Liquidity conditions verified  
- Settlement execution authorised  
- Capital deployment approved  

This view is designed for **instant executive assurance**, not analytical overload.

---

## 🚨 Executive Control Dashboard — System Volatile

When volatility thresholds are breached, Axiom-Zero automatically transitions to a **RED (VOLATILE)** state and suspends settlement execution to prevent capital leakage.

![System Volatile Dashboard](Project_4_Axiom-Zero-Global-Settlement/assets/Axiom_Dashboard_Red.png)

### Executive Interpretation
- Elevated market or liquidity risk detected  
- Settlement execution blocked  
- Capital preservation controls activated  
- Hedging or senior override required  

This mechanism ensures **risk decisions occur before exposure**, not after losses.

---

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### 🧠 Dynamic Risk Gate
- Calculates a proprietary **Quantum Volatility Index (QVI)** using statistical variance modelling  
- Enforces hard settlement blocks when instability exceeds defined limits  
- Functions as a **pre-settlement control**, not a retrospective report  

### 🔁 Automated Settlement Logic
- VBA-driven execution framework  
- Timestamped audit trail for every decision  
- Binary outcomes: **AUTHORISE / BLOCK**  

### 🧩 Executive Decision Support
- Traffic-light signalling (**STABLE / VOLATILE**)  
- High-contrast, gridless interface optimised for senior leadership  
- Designed to communicate **risk posture instantly**  

### 📈 Operational Integrity
- Engineered to maintain a **99.57% verified settlement success rate**  
- Focused on **capital protection over transaction throughput**
