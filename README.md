> **A mission-critical pre-execution risk gate designed to enforce capital preservation protocols. Axiom-Zero transitionary logic ensures that global settlements are only executed when market volatility and liquidity conditions meet strict regulatory and internal risk appetites.**

## 📋 Strategic Overview

Traditional risk management is often retrospective (reporting on losses after they occur). **Axiom-Zero** shifts the paradigm to **preventative governance**.

By acting as a **"Circuit Breaker"** for treasury operations, the engine evaluates real-time market telemetry to determine if a settlement should be **Authorised** or **Hard-Blocked**.

### Core Value Proposition:

- **Pre-Execution Gating:** Stops capital leakage before exposure occurs.  
- **Quantum Volatility Index (QVI):** Proprietary statistical variance model that monitors market stability.  
- **Executive Decision Intelligence:** Provides a "Zero-Click" assurance interface for C-Suite stakeholders.

## 📊 Governance Control States

### **State 1: System Stable (Execution Authorised)**

When the **QVI** remains within tolerance, the system signals a **STABLE** state, permitting the deployment of capital.

### **State 2: System Volatile (Execution Suspended)**

Upon breaching volatility or liquidity thresholds, **Axiom-Zero** triggers an immediate **Settlement Block**. This automated intervention protects the firm's liquidity during market stress.

## ⚙️ Engineering & Risk Logic

The engine is built on a robust framework of financial engineering and automated controls:

- **Dynamic Risk Thresholds:** Statistical modelling of variance to detect market anomalies.  
- **VBA Logic Layer:** Automated binary decision-making (Authorise/Block) with an immutable audit trail.  
- **Liquidity Validation:** Real-time checking of settlement corridors to ensure transaction success.  
- **Performance Metric:** Engineered to maintain a **99.57% verified settlement success rate**.
